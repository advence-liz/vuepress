// @import statements may be treated differently by Less depending on the file extension:

// If the file has a .css extension it will be treated as CSS and the @import statement left as-is (see the inline option below).
// If it has any other extension it will be treated as Less and imported.
// If it does not have an extension,  will be appended and it will be included as a imported Less file.
// Examples:

// @import "foo";      // foo is imported
// @import "foo"; // foo is imported
// @import "foo.php";  // foo.php imported as a less file
// @import "foo.css";  // statement left in place, as-is

// ## variable 

 @import "theme/var";

// ## mixin

 @import "mixin/clearfix";
 @import "mixin/grid-framework";
 @import "mixin/grid";
 @import "mixin/vendor-prefixes";

// ## common

 @import "normalize";
 @import "print";
//  @import "icon";
//  @import "image";

 // ## tools

 @import "utilities";

 // ### layout

 @import "scaffolding";
 @import "type";
//  @import "grid";
